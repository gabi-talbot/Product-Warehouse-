# Warehouse Management GUI

A warehouse management application written in Python with Tkinter

This project reads an inventory txt file, creates a list of product objects from the data using **Object Oriented Programming** and takes advantage of Tkinter's messagebox and simpledialog modules to provide input validation.
Users can navigate through options using the GUI and view, edit or add to the warehouse inventory file.
