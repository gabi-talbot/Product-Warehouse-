# Warehouse Management GUI

A graphical user interface(GUI) program created using Python's tkinter library for managing stock in a warehouse.

The program reads a file named "inventory.txt" which should be in the same directory as the program file. The main file creates a list of product objects from the data using the Shoe class and takes advantage of tkinter's messagebox and simpledialog modules to provide input validation. Users can navigate through options using the GUI to view, add new products to the txt file, restock and identify the highest and lowest stocked products.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- ttk
- messagebox
- simpledialog
